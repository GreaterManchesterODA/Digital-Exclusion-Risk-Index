# Methodology

## General process
The DERI score is composed of a number of calculations that each build on top of one another. The base level for these calculations is a series of individual indicators at an LSOA level. The general process is:

1. Individual indicators are used to create an individual indicator score for each LSOA.
2. These indicator scores are then weighted to create several component scores.
3. These components are then weighted to create the final DERI score.

The most important area of this work is the original indicator score calculation.

## Individual indicator scores
There are 10 individual indicators that make up the overall DERI score. These are individually weighted to form the next part in the calculation chain, the component scores. The score for each indicator in each LSOA is given as a number between 0 and 10, where 10 indicates a higher level of digital exclusion risk. The table below highlights for each indicator what level is considered a higher risk.

|Indicator|What is classed as 'higher risk'?|
|---|---|
|Proportion of population aged 65+||
|Proportion of population aged 75+||
|Proportion of over 65 residents on guaranteed Pension Credit||
|Proportion of 16+ population with no qualifications||
|Alternative unemployment rate||
|Index of Multiple Deprivation score||
|Proportion of homes unable to receive 30MBit/s broadband|A higher proportion of homes|
|Proportion of connections receiving less than 10MBit/s|A higher proportion of connections|
|Average download speed|A lower average download speed|
|Digital Hard to Count Score|A higher score|
