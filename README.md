# Digital Exclusion Risk Index
The Digital Exclusion Risk Index is a dataset and tool to explore the risk of digital exclusion across England, Wales and Scotland.

This repository holds information about the project to design and build the dataset and tool. It is being shared openly to support the wider use of the tool, reduce duplication of effort in creating digital exclusion indices, and come to a collective agreement about what indicators are best to portray the risk of digital exclusion on a local spatial scale.

The latest version is version 1.5, [available to access on Tableau](https://www.gmtableau.nhs.uk/t/GMCA/views/DigitalExclusionRiskIndexv1_5/DERIhomepage?%3Aiid=1&%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&%3Aembed=y) and with [methodology notes, datsets and sources on GitHub](/Version%201.5).

## Background
This work stems from original work produced by [Salford City Council](https://www.salford.gov.uk) to understand the risk of digital exclusion in the local area. Locality digital inclusion leads in Greater Manchester saw the value in utilising this work, rather than in creating multiple new risk indices, and as such [Greater Manchester Combined Authority](https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk) aimed to create a risk index that incorporates all areas of the country.

## Development
The aim is to develop the tool iteratively: develop a working prototype, testing with partners, and updating the tool. The latest version is [Version 1.5](/Version%201.5), which will be formally released on 22nd October 2021.

GMCA will commit to updating the data within the DERI, and look to continue development of the tool and dataset as new information is released.

## In this repository
There are multiple files and folders in this repository. This README file will always aim to list the folder for the most recent notes, developments, and data, as well as provide a link to the latest version of the tool.

You will also find an [FAQ document for general discussion](FAQ.md), and the [licence for the tool and dataset](Open%20Government%20Licence.md).

The folders in this repository include notes and details about each version and update, as well as a ['User Guide' folder](/Using%20the%20DERI). This folder is particularly useful, as it has the most recent User Guide for the tool; a discussion of how to use the DERI, and how not to use it; and a discussion of the potential extensions to the DERI that you might be interested in pursuing.
