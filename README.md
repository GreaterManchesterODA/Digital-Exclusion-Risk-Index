# Digital Exclusion Risk Index
An index of risk of digital exclusion across England, Wales and Scotland.

This project is designed to create a tool for wider use, reduce duplication of work in creating digital exclusion indices, and come to a collective agreement about what indicators are best to portray the risk of digital exclusion on a local spatial scale.

The latest version is version 1.1, [available to access on Tableau](https://www.gmtableau.nhs.uk/t/GMCA/views/DigitalExclusionRiskIndexv1_1/DERIhomepage/christopher.pope@greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/9767395d-5c8f-4904-b3b1-2e8dff1ddfb9?:display_count=n&:showVizHome=n&:origin=viz_share_link) and [methodology notes on GitHub](/Version%201.1).

## Background
This work stems from original work produced by Salford City Council to understand the risk of digital exclusion in the local area. Locality digital inclusion leads in Greater Manchester saw the value in utilising this work, rather than in creating multiple new risk indices, and as such Greater Manchester Combined Authority aimed to create a risk index that incorporates all areas of the country.

## Development
The aim is to develop the tool iteratively: develop a working prototype, test with partners, and update. The latest version is [Version 1.1](/Version%201.1).

The latest development includes makes only minor changes:
1. A change to the background map to show more detail
2. A small update to the size and positioning of features

Each future version will add a new folder, which will contain:
* Explanations for updates and changes
* Link to the new tool
* Development notes 
* Any new data or updates
