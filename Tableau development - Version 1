# Tableau development - Version 1

## Introduction
This document sets out the processes used to create version 1 of the Digital Exclusion Risk Index on Tableau. In comparison to the version 1 notes, which details the considerations and issues in calculatng and building the tool, this document sets out how one might build exactly the same tool in Tableau.

It covers the data input to version 1 of the tool, the calculated fields, the sheets created and the final dashboard.

The aim of this development document is to update users so that they can also create a similar tool using their own data, or to recreate the DERI tool in full.
