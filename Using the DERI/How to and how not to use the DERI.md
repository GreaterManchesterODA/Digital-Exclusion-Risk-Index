# How to and how not to use the DERI
## Introduction
It is important to note the uses and limitations of the DERI in order to understand how the tool, and data, can and should be used. This document aims to address some of those limitations and identify potential uses - and misuses - of the data and the tool.

## Limitations of the tool
### Data quality
The data used to create the tool came from a wide variety of sources, many of which come with their own limitations. For example, the deprivation component within the tool uses the Index of Multiple Deprivation as one indicator, which itself is a composite index that only provides an estimate of the degree of deprivation in an area. Equally, some of the indicators are calculated with reference to the ONS' Mid-Year Population Estimates dataset, which again is an estimate rather than an exact dataset. Similarly, much of the information has come through surveys that provide estimates only. As a result, the tool needs to be used as an indicative guide, rather than interpreted as absolute fact.

### Data recency
Not all of the data in the tool is up to date - some of the data has come from the 2011 census and is now a decade out of date. Other data sources are more recent, but there is significant variation in recency across the datasets. With some datasets in the tool being up to a decade out of date, users must be aware the the tool may not accurately reflect the true picture of digital exclusion risk today. We are aware of this limitation and will seek to update the data sources as and when newer versions of the source datasets become available.

### Geography
The tool is only currently available at Lower Super Output Area level in England and Wales and Data Zone level in Scotland. While ward boundaries are overlaid on the map view, indicator and DERI scores are only calculated for the LSOAs and Data Zones. The tool presents each LSOA/Data Zone as one homogenous area but there is likely to be variation within these geographical areas, so the scores should be interpreted with caution.

## What can the tool be used for?
### Context
The DERI tool can be used to provide context about the levels of digital exclusion risk in an area. It does not directly identify who is or is not digitally excluded, but instead provides information about the factors that are associated with digital exclusion, such as age, disability, deprivation, broadband connectivty, poverty, and skills levels. These factors can then be taken into consideration alongside local information to support further investigation or prioritisation of digital inclusion activities.

### Further investigation
By outlining the overall risk of digital exclusion in each LSOA/Data Zone, the DERI tool indicates which areas may have higher numbers of people at risk of digital exclusion or may require digital inclusion support. This information can be used as a starting point for policymakers to carry out further investigation, using more detailed local information and evidence, to explore where there is the greatest need for digital inclusion support.

Users can also change the weightings of indicator scores or component scores to investigate further the impact of these elements of the calculation. For example, you my wish to understand digital exclusion risk in the context of deprivation, and so adding a higher weighting to deprivation indicators would be of use.

### Prioritisation
One way to consider the DERI is as part of an overall risk matrix around digital inclusion to support the prioritisation of investigation and investment. Considering the DERI as an indicator of ‘likelihood’ – people are more likely to be digitally excluded in areas where the DERI score is high. However, adding in another dataset focused on where priority groups are more likely to live would provide the ‘impact’. As an example, anywhere with a high DERI score (likelihood) and a high proportion of disabled people (as a priority group, the ‘impact’) should be a key area of focus.

## What should the tool not be used for?
### Targets
One thing that the DERI should not be used for is to set targets to work towards particular scores in particular areas, such as reducing the risk score for an area from 8 to 4. As the index is a measure of relative risk of digital exclusion, reducing the score in one area will increase it in another area. Rather, the DERI should be used as a tool to think about the things that impact on digital exclusion, and what could be done to address those challenges more broadly.

### Change over time
The tool and dataset should not be used as an indicator over time – changes in a DERI score could occur because of, for example, older people moving out of an area. Therefore, as the tool is developed and updated information is added, this should not be seen as a change over time due to digital inclusion activities alone, but rather an updated view on the likelihood of being digitally excluded within an area.

### Investment without investigation
The DERI is a risk index: it does not mean that every person in a high-risk area is digitally excluded; nor does it mean that no-one in a low-risk area is digitally excluded either. It gives an overview of where targeting resources could have the most benefit. However, this alone should never be used to justify investment without further investigation. For example, an area may appear to be at high risk of digital exclusion but may already be well served by a number of digital inclusion programmes, and therefore the need for investment and support may be greater elsewhere. 

## Further exploration of the tool and dataset
The suggestions above are by no means an extensive list of uses, or uses-to-be-avoided. For more examples of how you might want to extend your use or analysis of the tool, check out [the guide on potential opportunities for extending the model](Opportunities%20for%20Extension.md).
