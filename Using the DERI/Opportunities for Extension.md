# Opportunites for Extension
## Introduction
The Digital Exclusion Risk Index is a tool in your toolkit. This does not mean that it shows everything that you need to know about digital exclusion, or that it provides a comprehensive overview.

As such, you may choose to consider using the dataset and tool as a base; extending or altering the tool; extending, adding to, or altering the dataset; developing something new with the data; or developing something new that complements the DERI.

This document provides some potential opportunities for extension that you might want to explore. Some of these may be taken forward by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority in future, but they are presented as options for you to explore.

If you would like to explore options for extension, please do so. The GMCA would be interested in what you do, but we claim no right over it - the dataset and notes about development are all released under an Open Government Licence. Rather, we would like to work with you on projects where this is beneficial to both parties.

If you would like to work with the GMCA on new tool developments, or would like to ask any questions about the tool, please contact us at oda@greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk.


## Dataset opportunities
There are several opportunities assoviated with the dataset itself. GMCA will commit to regularly updating and releasing new datasets. However, you may choose to do a number of things with the dataset to transform it for your needs.

### Changing the data
There is nothing to stop you taking a copy of the dataset from GitHub and changing the data within. We actively encourage this, especially where the dataset does not meet your needs.

One option for change would be to update the data within to newer datasets. Many of the source datasets are older than a year, and some datasets are static - for example, the Census information. While GMCA will update this data in time as new information comes out, you may wish to do this sooner.

Another option might be to change individual datasets. The composite Indices of Deprivation, produced by mySociety might npt be suitable for your needs, and a more specific national dataset might be more sensible to use for your purposes. Furthermore, you may wish to switch out the Indices of Deprivation for one of the domain scores or other component score within the indices.

A further change you may wish to take might be to take a cut of the dataset for a specific area, The DERI tool allows you to do this at a local authority level, but you may have a particular focus on different areas, such as neighbourhoods, wards, primary urban areas, CCG or ICS areas, or any number of potential geographical boundaries.
