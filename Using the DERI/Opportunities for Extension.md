# Opportunites for Extension
## Introduction
The Digital Exclusion Risk Index is a tool in your toolkit. This does not mean that it shows everything that you need to know about digital exclusion, or that it provides a comprehensive overview.

As such, you may choose to consider using the dataset and tool as a base; extending or altering the tool; extending, adding to, or altering the dataset; developing something new with the data; or developing something new that complements the DERI.

This document provides some potential opportunities for extension that you might want to explore. Some of these may be taken forward by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority in future, but they are presented as options for you to explore.

If you would like to explore options for extension, please do so. The GMCA would be interested in what you do, but we claim no right over it. Rather, we would like to work with you on projects where this is beneficial to both parties.
