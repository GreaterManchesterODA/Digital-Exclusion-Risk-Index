## Introduction
The Digital Exclusion Risk Index (DERI) creates a single number for each LSOA between 0 (low risk of digital exclusion) and 10 (high risk). This final DERI score is actually composed of three component scores:
*	Deprivation – includes IMD, skills, and welfare recipients
*	Demography – includes information on disabled people and older residents
*	Digital connectivity – primarily focuses on broadband access

In total, 11 indicators are used. Each of these is normalised based on the maximum and minimum values of that indicator in each district. So, for example, if one LSOA has the highest rate of 65+ residents in a district, it receives a score of 10; the LSOA with the lowest rate in the same district gets a score of 0. These indicators are then weighted and summed to produce the three components above. The components themselves are then weighted and summed to produce the final DERI score.
