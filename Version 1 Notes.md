# DERI Tool - Version 1 Notes

## Introduction


## Background


## Version 1
Version 1 of the tool is designed as a simple version of the tool, showing the very basic information: dashboards showing the final DERI score for each LSOA, and each of the digital exclusion components. It marks the first created version utilising a simple set of data, and was designed to produce something that could be tested with users.

It is also designed to show information for all of England, at the least. This expands the work from the original focus, which provided inofrmation for Salford only.

## Data inclusion
The data used is that indicated in the source document. That includes:
* Proportion of population aged 65+ (ONS Mid-year population estimates)
* Proportion of population aged 75+ (ONS Mid-year population estimates)
* Proportion of over 65 residents on guaranteed Pension Credit (DWP benefit claimants)
* Proportion of 16+ population with no qualifications (ONS Census 2011)
* Alternative unemployment rate (DWP Claimant count)
* Index of Multiple Deprivation score (MHCLG)
* Proportion of homes unable to receive 30MBit/s broadband (Ofcom Connected Nations)
* Proportion of connections receiving less than 10MBit/s (Ofcom Connected Nations)
* Average download speed (Ofcom Connected Nations)

However, the Digital Hard to Count score is not currently released by ONS. It has been shared individually with Census managers, but collating this information nationally would be difficult. Information provided by ONS suggests that this dataset will be released after the Census, and as such cannot be easily integrated into version 1.

> **DECISION:** Version 1 will not include an activity component, and therefore diverges from the [Methodology document](Methodology.md) and the [Data sources document](Data sources.csv).
