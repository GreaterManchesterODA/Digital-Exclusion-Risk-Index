# Digital Exclusion Risk Index - Version 1.0

This is the first version of the Digital Exclusion Risk Index (DERI). You can access the tool here.

This folder contains the foundational elements of the DERI, including:
 - The [methodology for the calculation of the DERI score](deri_score_methodology_v1.0.md) and relevant component scores
 - The [data sources](data_sources_v1.0.csv) for the DERI calculation
 - The [DERI dataset](deri_dataset_v1.0.csv), including the indicators going into the calculation, and the calculated scores
 - A [guide on how to develop the tool in Tableau](tableau_development_v1.0.md), including the way the DERI calculations were built, and what dashboard elements we used to create the DERI tool
 - A [general user guide](user_guide_v1.0.md) for using the DERI tool
 - A set of [additional notes](notes_v1.0.md) that didn't really fall easily into the other documents above, but which might be useful to you to know
