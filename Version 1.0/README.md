# Digital Exclusion Risk Index - Version 1.0

This is the first version of the Digital Exclusion Risk Index (DERI). You can access the tool here.

This folder contains the foundational elements of the DERI, including:
 - The methodology for the calculation of the DERI score and relevant component scores
 - The data sources for the DERI calculation
 - The DERI dataset, including the indicators going into the calculation, and the calculated scores
 - A guide on how to develop the tool in Tableau, including the way the DERI calculations were built, and what dashboard elements we used to create the DERI tool
 - A general user guide for using the DERI tool
 - A set of additional notes that didn't really fall easily into the other documents above, but which might be useful to you to know
