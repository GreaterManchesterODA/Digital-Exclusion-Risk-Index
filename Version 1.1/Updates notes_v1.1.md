# Updates to Version 1.1

[Version 1.1](https://www.gmtableau.nhs.uk/t/GMCA/views/DigitalExclusionRiskIndexv1_1/DeprivationScoredashboard?:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&:embed=y) of the Digital Exclusion Risk Index includes only minor changes. It was agreed that the most significant update at this point would be to update the background map of the tool on Tableau. This was done to include more place names, roads, rivers and coasts to provide a better understanding of place.

In Tableau, this is done by choosing the 'Map' topline option in the sheet that contains the map, and choosing an appropriate background map. We chose 'Streets' as an option.

`Map > Background maps > Streets`

The second change was in simply reorganising elements of the Tableau tool itself. These included aligning all of the different blocks of text and elements in the dashboards, to ensure they look the same throughout.
