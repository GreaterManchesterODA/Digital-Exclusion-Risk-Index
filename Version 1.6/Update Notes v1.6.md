# Update Notes for Version 1.6

This document has all the new notes for changes made between version 1.5 and version 1.6 of the Digital Exclusion Risk Index (DERI).

For full understanding of what goes into the DERI, it is important to read the version 1.0 summary and details as a foundation for the DERI dataset and tool. Each subsequent version of the tool will include updates to the relevant files in that folder.

The latest release of DERI is v1.6 which was released in November 2022. 
This includes data updates from:

**1. Age Component**
  - Mid Year Population Estimates 
    - Scotland, NRS SAPE 2020
    - England and Wales, ONS SAPE 2020

**2. Broadband Component**
  - Ofcom Data, May 2022, Connected Nations update on coverage availability by output area
  
**3. Deprivation Component**
  - Alternative Claimant Count, May 2022, Stat-Xplore
  - Pension Credit Caseload, February 2022, Stat-Xplore
  
**4. Dashboard refresh**
  - Refreshed some of the dashbord interface, to fix some reported issues in v1.5 such as the DERI scale on some dashboards

As not all the data has been updated to 2021 Census data, the boundaries that you see have no changes and are at 2011 level boundaries. Updating to 2021 boundaries is to be included in the next iteration of DERI.
